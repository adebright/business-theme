## What Inspired this project 
This project was insipired by the desire to solve the challenge we faced at ACE AFRICA.
We started as an out of the box start-up with interest in advancing digital knowledge but we had no remedy 
made tools on ground. 
As our service reach expand , we began to crumble because we were using third party tools to build our 
products.
The codes were annoying , varying , and not straight to the point.
We worked on different sections of any business application  but we had no unified format for delivering 
interface design.
Our dependence on bootstrap , jquery , and other third party codes were slowing down our advancement , and
making it hard to bring products fast to the market.
So , I setup with the intent to craft out clean interface from first principle with only vanilla codes.
The target for the project was to create ACE AFRICA INTERFACE LIBRARY , a collection of sleek , and simple 
CSS and Javascript codes to allow for faster development.
We are focused on building an easy to maintain codebase that will be loved by everyone.
With the rise of React , and react native , users will find this library useful since the codes can easily be 
converted into components  , and reused across your project.
